COVID19 related isolates sequenced in many countries are updated daily. The metadata of isolates is downloaded, it contains the following columns (shown as rows for readibility).
To summarize we collect information from column 7 (country) and count the number of isolates available for each country. If more information is needed it can be extracted from the downloaded metadata file. 

Please use /bin/sh summarize_isolates.sh
