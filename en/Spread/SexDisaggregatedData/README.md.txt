Note 1 :
15 April 2020 data update -  Column "DeathsAmongConfirmedCasesTotal" doesn't exist .

Note 2 :
*For these countries, these figures represent a proportion of overall cases where sex-disaggregated data is collected and reported 

**The UK data on deaths is taken from ONS reporting for England and Wales. This represents a small proportion of current deaths in England and Wales (and does not cover data for Scotland and Northern Ireland). The most recent ONS data reports deaths from the week of the 27 March. There is no data available on cases disaggregated by sex. Given that this data is weeks old, it has not been presented alongside current case data. 

*** The French data currently appears to be reporting sex-disaggregated data on deaths but not confirmed cases. However, previous data reported on 15 March included a breakdown of cases by sex and showed that 47% of cases and 58% of deaths were male. 

Please note, the male/female percentages for cases and deaths may not always add up to 100%, as some countries have a small number of cases where the sex is not known or reported

Update frequency:
Twice per week (normally on a Tuesday and Friday) and will continue to add to the number of countries and indicators included
