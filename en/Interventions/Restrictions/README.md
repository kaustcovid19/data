Each day download OxCGRT_Download_latest_data.xlsx file with the interventions from https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/OxCGRT_Download_latest_data.xlsx

Then execute code.R that process the intervention and population data and create files that will be read to create the visualizations in the dashboard

Coding for S1_School closing, S2_Workplace closing, S3_Cancel public events, S4_Close public transport, S6_Restrictions on internal movement is
0 - No measures, 1 - recommend closing, 2 - require closing
Coding for S1_IsGeneral, S2_IsGeneral, S3_IsGeneral, S4_IsGeneral, S6_IsGeneral is
0 - Targeted, 1- General
Missing values are NA

StringencyIndex: For each ordinal policy response measure S1-S7, we create a score by taking the ordinal value and adding one if the policy is general rather than targeted, if applicable. This creates a score between 0 and 2 and for S5, and 0 and 3 for the other six responses. We then rescale each of these by their maximum value to create a score between 0 and 100, with a missing value contributing 0.
Importantly, the Stringency Index should not be interpreted as a measure of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a governmentâ€™s response. It does not provide information on how well policies are enforced, nor does it capture demographic or cultural characteristics that may affect the spread of COVID-10. Its value is instead to allow for efficient cross-national comparisons of government interventions.
